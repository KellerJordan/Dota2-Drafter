# Dota2-Drafter
Program that suggests hero picks based on data scraped from dotabuff.com and input picked heroes. Designed to be run through an xampp server. Web scraping each time data is needed would be far too slow to be useful, so webpage has ability to store scraped data in sql server so it is available for instant access.
